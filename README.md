# Temperature-Converter-CPP

This is a temperature converter I made for my grandmother in C++ to practice C++ skills. My grandmother is from India and she always has problems understanding the Farhenheit temperature that is on our Devices. Now whenever I am on my computer and she asks for the temperature in Celsius instead of Fahrenheit, I just run this code. It can convert a given temperature in Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin to any of those three. It keeps running until the user chooses to exit the program.
